Mailchimp
=========

This module provides integration with the MailChimp email delivery service.
While tools for sending email from your own server, like SimpleNews, are great,
they lack the sophistication and ease of use of dedicated email providers like
MailChimp. Other players in the field are Constant Contact and Campaign Monitor.

The core module provides basic configuration and API integration. Features and
site functionality are provided by a set of submodules that depend upon the core
"mailchimp" module. These are in the "modules" subdirectory: See their
respective README's for more details.

Installation Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * You need to have a MailChimp API Key.
  * You need to have at least one list created in MailChimp to use the
    mailchimp_lists module.
  * If you use a drush make workflow, see the example drush makefile:
    mailchimp.make.example.

Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Direct your browser to admin/config/services/mailchimp to configure the
  module.

  2. You will need to put in your Mailchimp API key for your Mailchimp account.
  If you do not have a Mailchimp account, go to
  [http://www.mailchimp.com]([http://www.mailchimp.com) and sign up for a new
  account. Once you have set up your account and are logged in, visit:
  Account Settings -> Extras -> API Keys to generate a key.

  3. Copy your newly created API key and go to the
  [Mailchimp config](http://example.com/admin/config/services/mailchimp) page in
  your Backdrop site and paste it into the Mailchimp API Key field.

  4. Batch limit - Maximum number of changes to process in a single cron run.
  Mailchimp suggest keeping this below 10000.


Submodules
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * mailchimp_signup: Create anonymous signup forms for your Mailchimp Lists,
    and display them as blocks or as standalone pages. Provide multiple-list
    subscription from a single form, include merge variables as desired, and
    optionally include Interest Group selection.

  * mailchimp_lists: Subscribe any entity with an email address to MailChimp
    lists by creating a mailchimp_list field, and allow anyone who can edit such
    an entity to subscribe, unsubscribe, and update member information. Also
    allows other entity fields to be synced to Mailchimp list Merge Fields. Add
    a Mailchimp Subscription field to your User bundle to allow Users to control
    their own subscriptions and subscribe during registration.

  * mailchimp_campaigns: Create and send campaigns directly from Backdrop, or just
    create them and use the Mailchimp UI to send them. Embed content from your
    Backdrop site by dropping in any Entity with a title and a View Mode
    configured into any area of your email template.

  * mailchimp_activity: Display a tab on any entity with an email address
    showing the email, subscribe, and unsubscribe history for that email address
    on your Mailchimp account.
